# Kinde Terraform Provider

This provider allows you to manage your [Kinde](https://kinde.com/) resources using Terraform. It supports managing applications, APIs, roles, permissions, users, and organizations.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.20

## Authentication

The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used. You can provide your credentials via environment variables:

```sh
export KINDE_DOMAIN="https://your-domain.kinde.com"
export KINDE_AUDIENCE="https://your-domain.kinde.com/api"
export KINDE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

## Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kinde = {
      source = "nxt-fwd/kinde"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the provider using environment variables
provider "kinde" {}

# Or configure explicitly
provider "kinde" {
  domain        = "https://your-domain.kinde.com"
  audience      = "https://your-domain.kinde.com/api"
  client_id     = "your-client-id"
  client_secret = "your-client-secret"
}
```

See the [examples](./examples) directory for more usage examples.

## Resource Types

The provider includes the following resource types:

- `kinde_application` - Manage applications (regular web apps, SPAs, or M2M)

### Testing

The provider includes both unit tests and acceptance tests:
