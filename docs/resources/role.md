# kinde_role (Resource)

Roles represent collections of permissions that can be assigned to users. See [documentation](https://docs.kinde.com/kinde-apis/management/#tag/roles) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic role with minimal configuration
resource "kinde_role" "basic" {
  name = "basic_role"
  key  = "basic_role"
}

# Role with description
resource "kinde_role" "with_description" {
  name        = "admin_role"
  key         = "admin_role"
  description = "Administrator role with full access"
}

# Role with permissions
resource "kinde_role" "with_permissions" {
  name        = "editor_role"
  key         = "editor_role"
  description = "Editor role with specific permissions"
  permissions = [
    "perm_1234", # Replace with actual permission IDs
    "perm_5678"
  ]
}

# Full example showing all features
resource "kinde_role" "full_example" {
  name        = "full_role"
  key         = "full_role"
  description = "Complete role configuration example"
  permissions = [
    kinde_permission.create_users.id,
    kinde_permission.edit_users.id,
    kinde_permission.delete_users.id
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Description of the role. This field is required because the Kinde API does not properly handle unsetting or empty descriptions once they are set. To maintain consistent behavior and prevent state drift, we require a description for all roles.
- `key` (String) Key identifier of the role
- `name` (String) Name of the role

### Optional

- `permissions` (Set of String) List of permission IDs associated with this role

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID of the role
